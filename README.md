# iVelt Helper v2
A Chrome extension that adds shortcuts, notifications and other usability improvements to the [אייוועלט](https://www.ivelt.com/forum/) forum.

Most features can be turned on or off on the extension's settings page (right-click the toolbar icon → **Options**).

## Features

### Keyboard shortcuts
| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>→</kbd> / <kbd>←</kbd> | Previous / next page in a topic |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> | Jump to the top / bottom of the page (can be turned off) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | Submit the post |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> | Preview the post (quick reply and full editor) |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> | Go to אקטיווע אשכולות (active topics) |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> | Open the notifications list |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd> | Open the next unread notification |

### Post buttons
Extra buttons next to the regular quote button on every post:
* **Quote last only** – for posts with nested quotes, quote just the last reply.
* **Quote a selection** – select some words in a post and a ציטיר button shows up above them; it adds just those words, as a quote, at the top of your reply (after the quotes already there).
* **Mention** (דערמאן) – insert an empty quote so the poster gets a notification (optionally copies it to the clipboard instead).
* **Quote in another topic** – copy the post as a quote (with a source link and, optionally, its images) to paste in a different topic.
* **Who liked** – a small arrow on the like button opens the list of who liked the post, each name a link to their profile.
* **Quote in the comments topic** – for topics that have a linked קאמענטארן topic, open a reply there with the post already quoted.
* **Copy post link** – a plain click on the small post icon next to the author's name copies the post's link instead of opening it. Right-click and long-press work as before.
* Option to keep the post buttons visible while scrolling through a long post.

### Notifications
* Toolbar badge with your unread notification count, and optional browser notifications, even when אייוועלט isn't open.
* Alert when new replies arrive in the topic you're reading, with a reload button.
* Separate notification bells for quotes, thanks and mentions (ציטירט / באדאנקט / דערמאנט).
* Button to hide read notifications on the notifications page.
* Confirmation before "mark all as read", so it isn't clicked by accident.
* A mention (@name) in a post links to that user's profile.

### Writing posts
* Warning before leaving a page with an unsent post.
* **Drafts**: what you type in the reply box (quick reply or full editor) is kept as you type, so a crash or a closed tab doesn't lose it; the next time the same reply box opens, a bar shows when it was kept and its first lines, and offers to bring it back. Only sending the post drops the draft.
* **Image Resizer** on the post editor: images that are too big for an attachment are shrunk automatically, whether they are picked, dropped or pasted.
* **Paste images** straight into a post (like in Gmail): the image is attached and placed inline where you pasted it. This is a separate setting, so pasting can be on with the resizer off.
* Pack a whole folder into a single ZIP attachment (drop it on the editor, or use the **Folder → ZIP** button).
* **Google Drive upload**: shows which Google account it will use, then uploads files to a folder in your own Google Drive, makes them viewable by anyone with the link, and inserts the link into the post.
* The editor opens on the **Attachments** tab instead of **Options**, so adding a file is one click (can be turned off).

### Reading posts
* **Spoiler polish**: the spoiled words are covered with moving dust right where they are (so a couple of spoiled words stay in the middle of their line), and pictures are blurred with sparkling dots over them. A long spoiler shows only its first three lines. One click reveals it and opens it to its full height. Printed spoilers come out open. Off by default; turn it on in the settings.

### Other
* Google search within the current topic, or across the whole site.
* **Titles open the first unread post**: in a list of topics, clicking the title of a topic with unread posts opens it at the first unread post instead of the first page (can be turned off).
* Print several pages, or a whole topic, at once (forked from [bookmarkify.it/47839](https://bookmarkify.it/47839)).
* Toolbar popup with quick links (home page, inbox, active topics), quick sign-in, and emergency sign-out. Optionally, the quick links open in the current tab when it's already on the forum.

## Install from the Chrome Web Store
1. Open the **[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ivelt-helper-v2/ahidenbhdkloaingggdcijofobjboopi)** page.
   <sub>Using Microsoft Edge? Install from **[Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ivelt-helper-v2/hnklcnfpeamfiflmpnmjphigmbjoeknc)** instead.</sub>
2. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm **Add extension**.
3. Pin **iVelt Helper** to the toolbar so you can see the notification badge.

## Install from GitHub (manual install)
1. Download **ivelt-helper-x.x.x.zip** from the _Assets_ of the latest release on the **[Releases page](https://github.com/chucem/IveltChromeExtension/releases/latest/)**.
2. Extract it to an **ivelt-helper-x.x.x** folder and move it somewhere permanent. Chrome runs the extension from this folder, so it has to stay in the same place.
3. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked**, select the **ivelt-helper-x.x.x** folder, and click **Select Folder**.

## Building
`build.bat` zips the `extension` folder into `dist/ivelt-helper-<version>.zip` (requires [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) on the `PATH`).

## Releasing
1. Bump `version` in `extension/manifest.json` and merge it to `master`. The [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) then tags the merge as `v<version>`, builds the zip and creates the GitHub release with it attached.
2. To publish to the stores, go to **Actions → Store upload → Run workflow**, pick the release (blank = latest) and the store. The [Store upload workflow](.github/workflows/store-upload.yml) uploads that release's zip and, unless you uncheck it, submits it for review.

The store upload needs these repository secrets: `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (a Google Cloud service account JSON key) and `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` for the Chrome Web Store, and `EDGE_PRODUCT_ID`, `EDGE_CLIENT_ID`, `EDGE_API_KEY` for Edge Add-ons.

## Website and privacy policy
The extension's [website](https://chucem.github.io/) and [privacy policy](https://chucem.github.io/privacy.html) live in the [chucem.github.io](https://github.com/chucem/chucem.github.io) repo.
